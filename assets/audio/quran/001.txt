# Sample Audio File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the audio file 001.mp3 (Al-Fatihah).

To add actual Quran audio:
1. Download MP3 files from a reliable Islamic source
2. Rename them to match the pattern: 001.mp3, 002.mp3, etc.
3. Replace this .txt file with the actual .mp3 file

Note: Due to file size limitations, actual audio files are not included.
You can download high-quality Quran recitations from:

- https://quran.com/
- Other verified Islamic audio sources

Make sure to use recitations that are permissible and from trusted sources.
